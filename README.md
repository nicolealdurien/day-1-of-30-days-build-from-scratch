# 30 Days Build From Scratch - Day 1, To-Do List

Today, I learned/relearned:

- create-react-app is deprecated and in its place, people should use either a build tool like Vite or a framework like Next.js
- the keycode for "Enter" is 13 (contemplated adding a keydown listener so that hitting Enter would add a task to the list, but ran out of time)
