# 30 Days Build From Scratch - Day 1, To-Do List

To get more comfortable building from a totally blank slate, for the next 30 days, I'm going to see what/how much I can build from nothing in a single hour.

Today, I learned/relearned:

- `create-react-app` is deprecated and in its place, people should use either a build tool like Vite or a framework like Next.js
- the keycode for "Enter" is 13 (contemplated adding a keydown listener so that hitting Enter would add a task to the list, but ran out of time)

Today, I created a very basic, largely unstyled to-do list that permits:
  - adding new tasks
  - displaying the current list of tasks
  - removing a task from the list by checking a box to mark it completed
